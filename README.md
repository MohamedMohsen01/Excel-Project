## Achieving Business Insights through Excel Functions Project

I wanted to showcase some of the behind the scenes functions that I use when cleaning data in Excel. Also some of the functions used to make the data more useful.

Functions I used were: Cleaned the data, text to date, text to split columns, Len, Left, Mid, Right, Trim, SUMIFS -COUNTIFS -XLOOKUP - VLOOKUP - INDEX & MATCH- ROUNDUP - Sort & Filter - Conditional Formatting - Pivot Table with slicer and chart
